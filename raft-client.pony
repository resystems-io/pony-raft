	"""
	The raft acts as a gateway for sending commands to a server.

	There will be a 1-to-1 relationship between clients and "Rafts".
	The "Raft" has knowledge of the raft servers.
	"""

	// The strategy for selecting a server can be one of round robin,
	// or following of redirects.
	//
	// More specifically, we will contact the last-known-good server
	// based on redirects. However, if there is no "good" server, then
	// we will round robin.
	//
	// Note, we are _not_ attempting to handle retries. That is, while
	// the servers may have failed comms between them, we are not trying
	// to handle the case where the client can not reach a given server.
	//
	// The messages may simply be dropped. However, the raft may notify
	// the clients, asynchronously of:
	//   - leader updates
	//   - backpressure
	//   - dropped messages?
